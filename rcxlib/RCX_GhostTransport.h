/*
 * This Pipe is layered on Lego's Ghost API.  It has certain limitations
 * which make the RCX_SerialPipe preferable when serial port is being used.
 * However, for USB support on Mac OS 9, Ghost is the only viable option.
 *
 * Limitations of the GhostPipe:
 *	- fast mode is not supported (no fast firmware download)
 *	- always uses the USB Port for Ghost (no Ghost serial support)
 *	- deviceName is ignored, first USB device is always selected
 *  - user specified Rx Timeout is ignored (default Ghost timing always used)
